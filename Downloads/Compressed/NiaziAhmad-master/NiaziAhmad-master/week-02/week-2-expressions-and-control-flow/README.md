# Expressions and Control Flow

Get into *real* programming, installing a development environment and then
running our first programs.

## Material Review

- What is a programming language?
- What type of programming language is Python?
  <!-- an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language -->
- What do we need to write a program?
  <!-- a text editor, VS Code, PyCharm -->
- What is a statement?
  <!-- syntactic unit that expresses some action to be carried out -->
- What is a variable?
- What is variable declaration?
- What is variable assignment?
- What kind of variable types do you know?
  <!-- byte, int, float, boolean, char, String -->
- What is an operator?
- What type of operators do you know?
  <!--
    arithmetic operators:
      additive (+),
      subtraction (-),
      multiplication (*),
      division (/),
      floor/whole division (//),
      remainder (%)

    unary operators:
      logical complement (not)

    equality and relational operators:
      equal to (==),
      not equal to (!=),
      greater than (>),
      greater than or equal to (>=),
      less than (<),
      less than or equal to (<=)

    conditional operators:
      conditional-AND (and),
      conditional-OR (or)
    -->
- What is the *Hello World!* application?
- What is string concatenation?
- What is a *block*?
- What is an *if* statement?
- What is a *for-loop* statement?
- What is a *while-loop* statement?
- How can you get input from the user via command line?

## Individual Workshop Review

Please follow the styleguide:
[Our Python styleguide](../../styleguide/python.md)

- Is the directory structure and the name of the files correct?
- Are the includes placed on the top of the files?
- Is the indentation good in each file?
- Is there unnecessary code?
- Can you find unnecessary code in comments?
- Is there unnecessary code duplication?
- Are there unnecessary empty blocks?
- Can you spot unused variables?
- Is the commit message meaningful?
- Are the names of things following the styleguide?
- Are all the brackets in the perfect place?
- Whitespaces, where they should be, where shouldn't?
